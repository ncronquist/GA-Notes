-- 
-- **Note:** These use *GROUP BY* and *COUNT* which was not explicitly covered in class. Luckily, you have the whole internet as your disposal. Go forth and research.
-- 
-- 1. Get the COUNT of all books

SELECT COUNT(1)
FROM books;

-- * Get the COUNT of all Locations

SELECT 	count(Distinct(location))
FROM	subjects

-- * Get the COUNT of each unique location in the subjects table. Display the count and the location name. (hint: requires GROUP BY).

SELECT	location, count(1)
FROM	subjects
GROUP BY location


-- * List all books. Display the book_id, title, and a count of how many editions each book has. (hint: requires GROUP BY and JOIN)

SELECT	b.id, b.title, count(1) AS NumberOfEditions

GROUP BY b.id, b.title
